Using a dataset made up of songs from two musical genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based solely on information derived from the available data. First, I will use Pandas to analyze the data, aggregate information, and create charts with Seaborn or Matplotlib.
Next, I will use the scikit-learn library to predict whether I can correctly classify the genre of a song based on features such as energy, acousticness, tempo, danceability, etc."
