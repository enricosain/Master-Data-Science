__Credit Risk dataset__

__Context:__

The credit risk dataset contains simulated credit bureau data. In this notebook, we will deploy 11 different machine learning models, starting with baseline models and gradually moving on to more complex ensemble models. To optimize the hyperparameters of these models, we will be using randomized search with cross-validation (RandomizedSearchCV).

__Problem statement:__

Predict the customer loan status

__Problem type:__

Binary classification (supervised learning)
