This is my Master Degree Final Project. Here I'm going to work with a credit risk dataset, using 11 different machine learning models to predict the loan status of customers. The models will range from baseline to ensemble models, and I'll be using randomized search with cross-validation to optimize their hyperparameters. The problem type is binary classification, and the goal is to accurately predict whether a customer will default on their loan or not.
